<h3>HISTORY OF PEARL</h3>

<p>Long known as the "Queen of Gems," pearls possess a history and allure far beyond what today's wearer may recognize. Throughout much of recorded history, a natural pearl necklace comprised of matched spheres was a treasure of almost incomparable
  value, in fact the most expensive jewelry in the world. Now we see pearls almost as accessories, relatively inexpensive decorations to accompany more costly gemstones.
  Before the creation of cultured pearls in the early 1900s, natural pearls were so rare and expensive that they were reserved almost exclusively for the noble and very rich. A jewelry item that today's working women might take for granted, a
  16-inch strand of perhaps 50 pearls, often costs between $500 and $5,000. At the height of the Roman Empire, when pearl fever reached its peak, the historian Suetonius wrote that the Roman general Vitellius financed an entire military campaign by
  selling just one of his mother's pearl earrings.No one will ever know who were the earliest people to collect and wear pearls. George Frederick Kunz, whom I like to call America's first gemologist, in his 1908 masterpiece, The Book of the Pearl,
  states his belief that an ancient fish-eating tribe, perhaps along the coast of India, initially appreciated the shape and lustre of saltwater pearls, which they discovered while opening oysters for food.
  No matter the origin, a reverence for pearls spread throughout the world over the ensuing millennia. India's sacred books and epic tales abound with pearl references. One legend has the Hindu god Krishna discovering pearls when he plucks the
  first one from the sea and presents it to his daughter PandaÃ¯a on her wedding day. China's long recorded history also provides ample evidence of the importance of pearls. In the Shu King, a 23rd-century B.C. book, the scribe sniffs that as
  tribute, a lesser king sent "strings of pearls not quite round." In Egypt, decorative mother-of-pearl was used at least as far back as 4200 B.C., but the use of pearls themselves seems to have been later, perhaps related to the Persian conquest
  in the fifth century B.C. Rome's pearl craze reached its zenith during the first century B.C. Roman women upholstered couches with pearls and sewed so many into their gowns that they actually walked on their pearl-encrusted hems. Caligula, having
  made his horse a consul, decorated it with a pearl necklace.Circular display of pearls The Romans and Egyptians prized pearls above all other gems.
  Pearls, in fact, played the pivotal role at the most celebrated banquet in literature. To convince Rome that Egypt possessed a heritage and wealth that put it above conquest, Cleopatra wagered Marc Antony she could give the most expensive dinner
  in history. The Roman reclined as the queen sat with an empty plate and a goblet of wine (or vinegar). She crushed one large pearl of a pair of earrings, dissolved it in the liquid, then drank it down. Astonished, Antony declined his dinnerâ€”the
  matching pearlâ€”and admitted she had won. Pliny, the world's first gemologist, writes in his famous Natural History that the two pearls were worth an estimated 60 million sesterces, or 1,875,000 ounces of fine silver ($9,375,000 with silver at
  $5/ounce).

  The Arabs have shown the greatest love for pearls. The depth of their affection for pearls is enshrined in the Koran, especially within its description of Paradise, which says: "The stones are pearls and jacinths; the fruits of the trees are
  pearls and emeralds; and each person admitted to the delights of the celestial kingdom is provided with a tent of pearls, jacinths, and emeralds; is crowned with pearls of incomparable lustre, and is attended by beautiful maidens resembling
  hidden pearls."</p>

  been treasured since ancient times and ensures
  that pearl jewelry is always in style.</p>

  <P>Freshwater pearls are best known for their wide range of shapes, sizes, and colors, and their attractive prices. They are produced by the Hyriopsis cumingi, Hyriopsis schlegeli, and Cristaria plicata mussels, which live in lakes and rivers in
    China and Japan. The mussels are grafted with pieces of mantle tissue, resulting in pearls of solid nacre. About the size of a human hand, these mussels are able to produce up to 32 pearls at a time, up to 16 on either valve.Freshwater pearls
    form in various species of freshwater mussels, family Unionidae, which live in lakes, rivers, ponds and other bodies of fresh water. These freshwater pearl mussels occur not only in hotter climates, but also in colder more temperate areas such
    as Scotland (where they are protected under law). Most freshwater cultured pearls sold today come from China.Freshwater Pearls are the most widely available pearls seen in jewellery today. Hence, theyâ€™re the most affordable types of pearls in
    the market. </p>

    <h3>AKOYA PEARLS.</h3>

  <p>If youâ€™re thinking of a classic strand of white pearls, youâ€™ve probably got Akoya pearls in mind. These are the most well-known type of saltwater pearls and are sought after for their beauty, luster and competitive prices.Akoya pearls are the
    most abundant of the saltwater pearls. Most of the Akoya pearls on the market are produced in Japan, while a smaller percentage come from China, Vietnam and Korea. The Akoya pearls that come from Japan, however, are the best. You may come
    acrossthe term Hanadama Akoya when searching for pearls. This is the name given to the very best Akoya pearls that originate in Japan. In Japanese, Hanadama means â€˜flower pearlsâ€™.Akoya pearls were the first to be cultured in the 1920s. Prior to
    this,
    pearls were so rare and expensive that only the privileged could afford them. Culturing pearls brought down costs and made pearls readily available to everyone.</p>

    <h3>SOUTH SEA PEARLS.</h3>
  </li>

  <p>South sea pearls are the most prestigious of all the pearl varieties. They come in two main colors â€“ white and gold. While white south sea pearls have the traditional appearance of pearls, golden south sea pearls are quite a show-stopper! They
    are unique and very elegant in appearance. The golden variety are highly in demand at present as more people turn towards less conventional jewelry choices.South sea pearls are the largest of all pearl varieties and have an nu-mistakeable
    beautythat comes from the luster and color of the pearl. Most come from Australia, Philippines and Indonesia.These pearls can grow to be 20.0mm in diameter, but pearls over the size of 15.0mm are very rare. Larger pearls command higher prices
    and are
    ideal for statement jewelry. Regarding shape, most south sea pearls are irregular in form. This is why south sea pearls that are perfect spheres can command very high prices.</p>

    <h3>TAHITIAN PEARLS.</h3>

  <P>Tahitian pearls are the only naturally dark pearls on the market. As a modern and unique jewelry choice, Tahitian pearls have become very popular among pearl lovers and are one of the most sought after of pearl varieties.Like south sea pearls,
    Tahitian pearls also grow very large. But due to their unique colors and overtones, Tahitian pearls stand out more than any other pearl variety. Although they are called black pearls, they are rarely completely black. Tahitian pearls are often
    dark gray, charcoal and green with various overtones. The most popular overtone is â€˜peacockâ€™ which has the beautiful spectrum of colors that can be found in a peacock feather or an oil slick, if you will. These overtones appear to shimmer over
    the dark body of the pearl, creating an arresting and unique look.Tahitian pearls come in a variety of shapes, including round, baroque and circle. Round pearls are the most expensive and sought after, but irregular shaped Tahitian pearls
    displaymore color and shimmer with gorgeous overtones as the light reflects off the many angles. They are also more affordable making them a great option for any jewelry collection.</p>
